Augustin Louis Cauchy:

Date of birth August 21, 1789
Place of birth Paris
Date of death May 23, 1857 (67 years old)
Scientific field mathematics
He is known as having developed the foundations of mathematical analysis
Cauchy wrote over 800 works, the complete collection of his works contains 27 volumes. His works relate to various fields of mathematics (mainly mathematical analysis) and mathematical physics.
Only Leonard Euler wrote more of it.

He was born in the family of an official, a deeply religious monarchist. He studied at the Polytechnic School (1805), then moved to the Paris School of Bridges and Roads (1807). After graduation, he became a railway engineer in Cherbourg. Here he began independent mathematical research.

In 1811-1812, Cauchy presented several works to the Paris Academy. In 1813 he returned to Paris, continued his mathematical research.

Since 1816, Cauchy was appointed a member of the Academy by a special royal decree (instead of the exiled Monge). Cauchy's memoir on the theory of waves on the surface of a heavy liquid receives the first prize at a mathematical competition, and Cauchy is invited to teach at the Polytechnic School.

In 1818 he married Alois de Buer. They had two daughters.

In 1821 he published the work "Algebraic Analysis" on the foundations of analysis.

After the July Revolution (1830), Cauchy was forced, by virtue of his clerical-royalist sentiments, to emigrate with the Bourbons. He lived mainly in Turin and Prague, being for some time the tutor
of the Duke of Bordeaux, the grandson of Charles X, for which he was made a baron by the exiled king.

In 1836, Charles X died, and the oath to him lost its force. In 1838, Cauchy returned to Paris, but because of his dislike of the new regime, he did not want to take any government positions. He confined himself to teaching at a Jesuit college. It was only after the new revolution (1848) that he received a place at the Sorbonne, although he did not take the oath; Napoleon III left him in this position in 1852.

Augustin Louis Cauchy died on May 23, 1857 at 4 a.m. in Sault (Hauts-de-Seine), France
